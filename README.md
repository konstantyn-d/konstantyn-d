# Hi, I’m Konstantyn 👋

I build scalable data systems in AWS: ingestion, transformation, storage, and data quality.

I like clean architectures, reliable pipelines, and metrics that actually drive decisions.

My main stack is Python, SQL, and AWS (S3/Athena). I also work with data modeling and ETL/ELT patterns.

Pinned below: end-to-end pipeline projects with diagrams, tests, and production-style docs.
