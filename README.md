# Hi, I’m Konstantyn 👋

**Data Engineer** building **scalable data systems in AWS** — from ingestion and transformation to storage, data quality, and monitoring.

### What I do
- Design and build **data pipelines** (batch → orchestration-ready)
- Work with **data lakes / warehouses** and **data modeling**
- Add **data quality checks** and **observability** (metrics, run logs, reliability)

### Current focus
- **AWS** (S3, Athena, Lambda/EC2 fundamentals)
- **Python + SQL** for production-grade data workflows
- Portfolio projects that mirror real-world engineering patterns

### Tech
**Python • SQL • AWS • Data Modeling • ETL/ELT • Pandas • Airflow • Git/GitHub**

📌 Portfolio projects and architecture notes are pinned below.
